# Titanic Dataset Analysis

## Overview

This repository contains a Python script for analyzing and visualizing the Titanic dataset. The dataset provides information about passengers aboard the Titanic and their survival status. The script demonstrates data loading, cleaning, statistical analysis, and visualization using libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn.
